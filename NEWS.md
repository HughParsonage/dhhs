## dhhs 0.4.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

### `read_sitrep`
* `columns` now accepts absent columns (the intersection is used)
* `Latitude` and `Longitude` are fixed internally in `read_sitrep`
* `view` is now more lenient, accepting wrong case and slight misspellings.
